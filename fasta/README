### Scripts for manipulating fasta files


#### Selecting fasta sequences based on a list
```
python selectSequence.py -t include -c sample_files/contigs_to_exclude_sample.txt -l 5000 -f sample_files/spades07_BM03_scaffolds_sample.fasta
```


#### Calculating sequence complexity for a sequence of a given span around each position in bed file
```
python calcComplexity.py 10 sample_files/spades07_BM03_scaffolds_sample.fasta sample_files/intervals.bed
```
